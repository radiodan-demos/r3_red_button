- how to control the player from a web application
- playing a remote stream
- playing a local file

See the [Radiodan Client Library documentation](http://radiodan-client.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for all the commands that you can use.

## Requirements

- mpd
- node.js / npm
- OS X / Pi 2 (arm7)

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/radiodan/radiodan-skeleton.git
